/**
 * This is a type class used to convert given types to `Markers`.
 *
 * Markers are very useful for structured logging, because they can be
 * converted into key/value pairs without altering the structure of a
 * message or keeping the ordering in arguments (especially since an
 * exception must be at the end of the tail).
 *
 * The API does not define type class instances in this layer, but
 * the logstash package provides many useful mappings to Markers.
