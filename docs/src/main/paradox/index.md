# Blindsight

Blindsight is a Scala logging API that is based around @ref:[structured logging](usage/dsl.md), @ref:[fluent logging](usage/fluent.md), @ref:[semantic logging](usage/semantic.md), @ref:[flow logging](usage/flow.md), @ref:[context aware logging](usage/context.md), @ref:[conditional logging](usage/conditional.md), and @ref:[other useful things](usage/overview.md). 
 
It is heavily informed by the [blog posts at tersesystems.com](https://tersesystems.com/category/logging/) and the [diagnostic logging showcase](https://github.com/tersesystems/terse-logback-showcase).

The name is taken from Peter Watts' excellent first contact novel, [Blindsight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindsight_\(Watts_novel\)).
