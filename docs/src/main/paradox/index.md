# Blindsight

Blindsight is a Scala logging API that allows for fluent logging, semantic logging, and context aware logging.  It is heavily informed by the [blog posts at tersesystems.com](https://tersesystems.com/category/logging/) and the [diagnostic logging showcase](https://github.com/tersesystems/terse-logback-showcase).

The name is taken from Peter Watts' excellent first contact novel, [Blindsight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindsight_\(Watts_novel\)).
